Hello,
This is a simple flow I made for opportunity records standardization.
This flow takes the user input for the Opportunity name field ( upon creation of an opportunity ) and automatically updates it to a standard.
It can be modified for different business uses.
I wanted all of the records inside the opportunity to be as such:
Season/Year – Account Name – 6-digit random number.
-	Sale season/year  –  used to track the year and season  this record was created.
-	Name of account –  used to track the company/person this opportunity is for.
-	Random number of 6 digits – ok so the 6 digits are not mandatory, it can be 3,4,5, or any number you would like ( the total number of characters must be under 120 )

This is my first time trying to create this type of flow so it should be fun. ( I hope so )
So how can we do this?
Go to Setup  –  Search for “flows”  –  New Flow
Now we’ll use “Start from scratch” and select “Record triggered flow”
We want to add the Object as Opportunity and be triggered when a record is created.
Also, for better optimization, we need to set the flow for FFU ( Fast Field Updates ) – this means that the update of the name is done before the record is saved, therefore it saves us some resources.
After pressing the add element button and select the “update records” element you should edit the “Set Field Values for the Opportunity Record”.
On the left part of the flow builder you have the “Resources” part.
For creating a new formula you select “New Resource” and select formula.
First Formula is for : Season/Year
( name of the formula is SaleSeasonYear )
" IF(
   MONTH(TODAY()) >= 3 && MONTH(TODAY()) <= 5,
  "Spring",
  IF(
    MONTH(TODAY()) >= 6 && MONTH(TODAY()) <= 8,
    "Summer",
    IF(
      MONTH(TODAY()) >= 9 && MONTH(TODAY()) <= 11,
      "Fall",
      "Winter"
    )
  )
) & "/" & TEXT(YEAR(TODAY())) "

This should give us the first part of the standard opportunity name, and it should be in the format Season/Year ( ex. Spring/2025 )
For the Account name we simply use {!Record.AccountName}
And now, for the most painfull part, we need a new formula for the random number
( because I didn’t find a quick way to generate that random number, I used a formula which takes the month, hour and minute the opportunity record was created and assigns it as "000000" format )
The formula looks like this: 
( name of the formula is "RandNumber" )
" LPAD(MID(TEXT(NOW()), 6, 2), 2, "0") & 
  LPAD(MID(TEXT(NOW()), 12, 2), 2, "0") & 
  LPAD(MID(TEXT(NOW()), 15, 2), 2, "0") "


Now let's test it.
So upon creating a new opportunity, for the name value I entered something random ( the letter “h” ) and this is the output.
